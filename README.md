## Description
Cypress was used to test a quiz site's components and user journey. Component tests verified features like question display, timers, and answer selection. End-to-end tests ensured smooth navigation, answer submission, and result accuracy, providing confidence in functionality and user experience.

## Usage
Cypress was used to test the functionality of the quiz test site by validating individual components, such as question display and answer selection, and performing end-to-end tests to ensure smooth user flows, from starting the quiz to viewing results. It helps catch bugs and ensures a reliable user experience.
